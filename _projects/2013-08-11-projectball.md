*The completed ball robot prototype*

In this project, we successfully built a ball-shaped Home CCTV robot, which targets working parents who leave their children at home.

For locomotion, 'rolling mechanism' was used, while ballasts were used to steer the robot. Webcam embedded in the robot is used to monitor the indoor environment and LED dot matrix attached to the robot can be controlled by parents to send messages to their children.

During the project, I developed the Arduino-based control system.

The result had been awarded **KIPO Special Award (Commissioner of Korean Intellectual Property Office, 900$)** in the Korea STEAM Competition 2013. [[News](http://www.ajunews.com/kor/view.jsp?newsId=20130815000244)]
