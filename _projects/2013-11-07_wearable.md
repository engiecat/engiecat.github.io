**WearDroid - Hand gesture based wearable platform with full android compatibility (2013)**  
Microrobot Research, KAIST

In this project, based on hand tracking and hand gesture detection, we successfully implemented an input device that directly interacts with Android Operating System. The hand gesture is converted to touch motion, which is simulated on general mobile device that runs Android. 

The hand gesture was detected both using flex sensor powered gloves and camera based hand-tracking algorithm. Such gestures were converted to touch signal (touch, drag, no-touch). 'Virtual touch' was generated via overriding touchscreen input driver. By such method, the user could interact with any applications available on Android via hand gesture, while viewing the displayed content via HMD(Head Mounted Display, then EPSON Moverio BT-100 was used)

The result had been awarded **Honorary Mention for Excellent Idea (the head of Korea Institute of Next Generation Computing, 900$)** in the Wearable Computer Competition 2013.
