Hyeongkeun ‘Hugo’ Kim is currently a senior student in KAIST and pursuing his undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a dual major in Bio-Brain engineering (Spring 2020). From 2013 to 2015, Hugo was a recipient of Korea Presidential Science Scholarship. 

Hugo is interested in Robotics, Automation in Biology, Lab-on-a-Chip and Machine Learning.

With the background in both Mechanical Engineering and Bioengineering, Hugo participated in several research projects that applied robotics to the field of biology. 

In 2016, Hugo joined NAVER Labs Robotics Group (currently NAVER LABS Corp.) as an intern and developed TuskBot, a bio-inspired wheeled-robot platform that can traverse any stairs, with other interns. TuskBot had been presented in IROS 2017 and received domestic media coverage from [Chosun-ilbo](http://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/06/25/2017062501522.html), [SBS-CNBC](http://sbscnbc.sbs.co.kr/read.jsp?pmArticleId=10000878098), [ZDNet Korea](http://www.zdnet.co.kr/news/news_view.asp?artice_id=20171016113135) and so on.

Before NAVER LABS, Hugo had been a member of [MR (Microrobot Research)](https://mr.kaist.ac.kr/w5.html), a robotics club in KAIST. In the club, Hugo co-founded Team W5, a team that seeks seamless integration of robotics in biology research. BioLab-MYCO, one of their works, had been presented in the 2014 Intel Korea Year-End Press Conference, received domestic media coverage from [CNET Korea](https://www.cnet.co.kr/view/123762) and so on, and published in Sensors as a [journal article](https://doi.org/10.3390/s16060942).
