Hyeongkeun ‘Hugo’ Kim is an incoming Ph.D. student (Fall 2020) in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign([UIUC MechSE](https://mechse.illinois.edu/)). Hugo received his bachelor's degrees in [Mechanical Engineering](http://me.kaist.ac.kr/eng/main/main.html), with a dual major in [Bio and Brain engineering](https://bioeng.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST (Spring 2020, *Cum Laude*). From 2013 to 2015, Hugo was a recipient of Korea Presidential Science Scholarship. 

Hugo is interested in Robotics, Automation in Biology and Machine Learning.

With the background in both Mechanical Engineering and Bioengineering, Hugo participated in several research projects that applied robotics to the field of biology. 

In 2016, Hugo joined [NAVER](https://www.navercorp.com/en/index.nhn) Labs Robotics Group (currently [NAVER LABS](https://www.naverlabs.com/en/) Corp.) as a research intern and developed TuskBot, a bio-inspired wheeled-robot platform that can traverse any stairs, with other interns. TuskBot had been presented in [IROS 2017](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8206614/) and received domestic media coverage from [Chosun-ilbo](http://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/06/25/2017062501522.html), [SBS-CNBC](http://sbscnbc.sbs.co.kr/read.jsp?pmArticleId=10000878098), [ZDNet Korea](http://www.zdnet.co.kr/news/news_view.asp?artice_id=20171016113135) and so on.

Before NAVER LABS, Hugo had been a member of [MR (Microrobot Research)](https://mr.kaist.ac.kr), a robotics club in KAIST. In the club, Hugo co-founded Team [W5](https://mr.kaist.ac.kr/w5.html), a team that seeks seamless integration of robotics in biology research. BioLab-MYCO, one of their works, had been presented in the 2014 Intel Korea Year-End Press Conference, received domestic media coverage from [CNET Korea](https://www.cnet.co.kr/view/123762) ([Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20150726172013/https://www.cnet.co.kr/view/123762)) and so on, and published in Sensors as a [journal article](https://doi.org/10.3390/s16060942).
