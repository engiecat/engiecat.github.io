Hyeongkeun 'Hugo' Kim is a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://mechse.illinois.edu/), advised by Prof. William P. King and Prof. Sameh H. Tawfick. Hugo is a recipient of the [2025-2026 Mavis Future Faculty Fellowship](https://mavis.grainger.illinois.edu/) from The Grainger College of Engineering. 

His research lies at the intersection of solid mechanics, additive manufacturing, and machine learning, with a focus on establishing reliable structure-property relationships in architected materials and creating robust, high-performance architected materials using experimental data-driven approach. Furthermore, with the background in both Mechanical Engineering and Bioengineering, Hugo is working on applying the approach for design and process optimizations in biomanufacturing applications.

**Current Research**

Hugo is a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Intelligent Manufacturing and Thermal Systems Laboratory](https://kinglab.mechse.illinois.edu/). His doctoral research, "Mechanics of Additively Manufactured Soft Lattice Structures and Architected Materials", combines experimental mechanics with data-driven models to predict and optimize the behavior of architected materials.

His key research directions include:
* **Experimental Data-Driven Mechanics:** Developing Gaussian Process regressors and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict the non-linear compression response of architected materials.
* **Automated Metrology:** Implementing custom telecentric imaging systems and digital image tracking software to capture manufacturing defects, deformations and fracture events in real-time.
* **Bio-Manufacturing Automation:** As part of the [ARPA-H MASCOT project](https://grainger.illinois.edu/news/stories/arpa-h-tumor-models) ($21M funding), Hugo manages the design and integration of a $4 million automated biomanufacturing system for reproducible tumor models.

**Previous Experience**

In 2016, Hugo joined [NAVER](https://www.navercorp.com/en/index.nhn) Labs Robotics Group (currently [NAVER LABS](https://www.naverlabs.com/en/) Corp.) as a research intern and developed TuskBot, a bio-inspired wheeled-robot platform that can traverse any stairs, with other interns. TuskBot had been presented in [IROS 2017](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8206614/) and received domestic media coverage from [Chosun-ilbo](http://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/06/25/2017062501522.html), [SBS-CNBC](http://sbscnbc.sbs.co.kr/read.jsp?pmArticleId=10000878098), [ZDNet Korea](http://www.zdnet.co.kr/news/news_view.asp?artice_id=20171016113135) and so on.

Before NAVER LABS, Hugo had been a member of [MR (Microrobot Research)](https://mr.kaist.ac.kr), a robotics club in KAIST. In the club, Hugo co-founded Team [W5](https://mr.kaist.ac.kr/w5.html), a team that seeks seamless integration of robotics in biology research. BioLab-MYCO, one of their works, had been presented in the 2014 Intel Korea Year-End Press Conference, received domestic media coverage from [CNET Korea](https://www.cnet.co.kr/view/123762) ([Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20150726172013/https://www.cnet.co.kr/view/123762)) and so on, and published in Sensors as a [journal article](https://doi.org/10.3390/s16060942).
