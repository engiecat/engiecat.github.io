**MR(Microrobot Research), KAIST**  
Regular Student Member(2013 - ), Co-founder of Team W5.KAIST(2014 - ) 

From 2013 Spring, right after I entered KAIST, I joined MR (Microrobot Research), the robotics club in KAIST, which is renowned for its portrayal in 90's K-drama \<KAIST\>. As a regular member, I participated in various projects, ranging from Wearable Computing to Autonomous Motorboats, and Ball-shaped 'rolling' robot. 

From 2014, I and colleagues founded [Team W5](https://mr.kaist.ac.kr/w5.html) (Which Was What We Wanted) inside the club to seek 'seamless integration between robotics and biology'. Initially formed to compete in Korea CanSat Competition 2014, W5 became one of the most successful team in the history of MR. 

In the team, I designed H/W, dealt with rapid prototyping, and developed embedded softwares. Additionally, I also dealt with biological experiments.
